If you have any questions about SUMO, please post them into one of our
mailing lists. You may need to [create an Eclipse
account](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register) first.

**Please do not try to add the lists to your social networks\!**

There are three lists available:

- [sumo-user](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/sumo-user)<br>
  This is the first place you should ask your questions. Several
  people are observing it and may give you some hints. Before you post
  to the list, please check the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for already
  answered questions. If you have a novel question, [here is some general advice before asking](FAQ.md#what_should_i_do_to_get_helpful_answers_on_the_mailing_list).
  If you wish to report an error [please follow these suggestions](FAQ.md#how_do_i_report_erroneous_behavior_of_a_sumo-application).
  Subscribe to this list for asking questions, reporting issues and
  getting information about what other people ask.
  Frequency: about 100 mails per month

!!! note
    There is also a [forum available](http://sumo-user.90755.n8.nabble.com/) to access the sumo-user mailing list. Please be aware that every message to the forum also goes to all sumo-user subscribers and vice versa. You need to register for the forum, but you only need a valid email, not an Eclipse account.

- [sumo-announce](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/sumo-announce)<br>
  Subscribe to the list if you want to get information about new
  releases or documents.
  Post to the list if you have to announce something by yourself.
  Frequency: few mails per year
  Archive: [Eclipse Archive](https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/sumo-announce/), [Mail Archive](https://www.mail-archive.com/sumo-announce@eclipse.org/), [SF Archive](https://sourceforge.net/p/sumo/mailman/sumo-announce/)

- [sumo-dev](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/sumo-dev)<br>
  This list is for topics related to sumo development. If you want to
  contribute code or ask a question in regard to extending SUMO, this
  is the right place.
  Frequency: few mails per month

To **unsubscribe**, please visit the same link(s) as given above for
subscription. You will find a field there that allows you to
unsubscribe. An easy way to subscribe (or unsubscribe) is to write an
email to
[mailto:sumo-user-join@eclipse.org](mailto:sumo-user-join@eclipse.org)
(or

for unsubscribing). Make sure to use the right sender address (subject
and body can be empty). This works of course for the devel and the
announce list as well.

know by using the project's [bug tracking service](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/issues).
