# jtcrouter.py
The **J**unction**T**urn**C**ountRouter generates vehicle routes from turn-count data.
It does so by converting the turn counts into into flows and turn-ratio files that are suitable as [jtrrouter](../jtrrouter.md) input.
Then it calls jtrrouter in the background. The turn

```
<SUMO_HOME>/tools/jtcrouter.py -n <net-file> -t <turn-file> -o <output-file>
```
There are three basic styles of converting turn-counts to routes:

- Flows start at all turn-count locations in the network but end when reaching the next count location
- Flows start at all turn-count locations in the network and are discounted when reaching the next count location (**--discount-sources**)
- Flows only start on the fringe of the network (**--fringe-flows**)

## Turn count data format
The turn-count data must be provided in the format:
```
<interval id="generated" begin="0.0" end="99.0">
        <edgeRelation from="-58.121.42" to="64" count="1"/>
        <edgeRelation from="-58.121.42" to="-31" count="3"/>
        <edgeRelation from="45" to="-68" count="3"/>
        <edgeRelation from="-31.80.00" to="31" count="1"/>
        <edgeRelation from="-31.80.00" to="37" count="1"/>
        <edgeRelation from="-31.80.00" to="-23" count="13"/>
        <edgeRelation from="-92.180.00" to="-60" count="1"/>
</interval>
```

# routeSampler.py
The script generates routes from turn-count data, edge-count and even origin-destination-count data. It requires a route file as input that defines possible routes. Routes are sampled (heuristically) from the input so that
the resulting routes fullfill the turn-count data.

```
<SUMO_HOME>/tools/routeSampler.py -r <input-route-file> -t <turn-files. -o <output-file>
```

The turn-count data format is the same as as described [above](#turn-count-data-format).
In addition to loading a turn-count file, routeSampler can also load an [edgeData
file](../Simulation/Output/Lane-_or_Edge-based_Traffic_Measures.md) using option **--edgedata-files**.
The attributes for reading the counts from the turn-data file and edgedata-file
can be set with options

- **--turn-attribute** (default 'count')
- **--edgedata-attribute** (default 'entered')

!!! note
    When using routeSampler as a replacement for [dfrouter](../dfrouter.md) or [flowrouter.py](Detector.md#flowrouterpy), the flow input files can be converted to edgeData files with the tool [edgeDataFromFlow.py](Detector.md#edgedatafromflowpy)

## Obtaining initial routes
Routes generated by randomTrips.py (**--route-output**) can be a good input source. The following randomTrips.py options may be helpful:

- **--fringe-factor**: setting a high value will generated lots of through-traffic which is plausible for small networks
- **--min-distance**: restricting short routes increases the chance that routes passing multiple counting locations are generated
- **--speed-exponent**, **--lanes**: both options can be used to increase routes starting and ending on "important" roads. This combines well with the **--fringe-factor**-option to generate many routes that enter and leave the network on major roads.

## Generalized route restrictions
By default, the input options --edgedata-files and --turn-files allow restricting counts for single edges and pairs of consecutive edges. 

To define count restrictions for longer consecutive edge sequences the optional 'via' attribute can be used for `<edgeRelation>` elements:
```
   <edgeRelation from="A" to="D" via="B C" count="42"/>
```

To define count restrictions on non-consecutive edges the option **--turn-max-gap <INT>** can be used. Example:
When setting option **--turn-max-gap 2**, the edgeRelation `<edgeRelation from="A" to="D" .../>` would apply to routes containing "A B", "A X D" or "A X Y D" but not "A X Y Z D".
        
## Origin-Destination restrictions
When loading an edgeRelation file with the option **--od-files**, origin-destination counts will be added.
This can be used to combine (edge-based) OD-relations with other couting data.
        
## Output Styles
By default, routeSampler will generate individual vehicles with embedded routes. This can be changed with the following options (which can also be combined):

- **--write-route-ids**: write named routes and let vehicles reference the route via it's id
- **--wroute-route-distribution STR**: put all routes into a route distribution (with appropriate route probabilities) and let a all vehicles reference this distribution (Simulation counts will then vary due to sampling from the distribution)
- **--write-flows number**: write `<flow>`-definitions instead of vehicles. The exact number of flow vehicles will be spaced evenly between the earliest and latest vehicle departures that would have been generated by default
- **--write-flows probability**: write `<flow>`-definitions instead of vehicles. Flows will be defined with attribute 'probability' so that the expected number of vehicles is equal to the number of vehicles that would have been generated by default but the specific number will vary due to sampling effects

## Optimization
By default, routes will be sampled from the input route set until no further routes can be added without exceeding one of the counts. This may still leave some counts below their target values. At this point an ILP-Solver can be used to swap out routes and get closer to the target values or even reach the exact numbers.
By setting option **--optimize <INT>**. The number of times that a route is used can be changed by up to **<INT>** times. This defines a trade-off between using routes in the same distribution as found in the input and optimizing the counts.
When setting option **--optimze full**. No constraints on the route distribution are set and any route can be used as often as needed to reach the counts.

## Further Calibration
It is possible to load the resulting output into routeSampler.py for another round of optimization. By setting the option **--optimize-input** the sampling step is skipped and the optimizer is run directly on the input route set.

By removing specific routes or adding new ones, the user can thus tailor the generating traffic in an iterative manner.
 
# generateTurnRatios.py

This script is used to calculate the turn ratios from a
an edge to its downstream edge with a given route file. The output file
can be directly used as input in [jtrrouter](../jtrrouter.md). The time interval will span the minimum and maximum departure times of the route file.

```
<SUMO_HOME>/tools/generateTurnRatios.py -r <route-file>
```

The standard output is the traffic volumes (which jtrrouter normalizes automatically). With the option **-p**,  turning ratios will be written as values from [0,1].


# generateTurnDefs.py

This script allows generation of the turn definitions based on the
number of lanes allowing particular turns. The basic functionality
distributes the traffic uniformly, that is:

1.  distribute the incoming traffic uniformly across the lanes forming
    the road
2.  distribute the amount of traffic assigned to each lane uniformly
    among the destinations that the lane allows turns to.
3.  sum up the values for each of the destinations that the road being
    processed allows turning to.

Example use

```
<SUMO_HOME>/tools/turn-defs/generateTurnDefs.py --connections-file connections.con.xml --turn-definitions-file output.turndefs.xml
```

The script allows to be extended with new traffic distribution policies
(for example, based on Gaussian distribution) easily. See the
*DestinationWeightCalculator* class for details.

The script processes the connections given in the provided *\*.con.xml*
file. For usage details, execute the *generateTurnDefs.py* script with
*--help* option.

!!! note
    You can generate a connections file with all the connections in the network using [netconvert](../netconvert.md) - see the *--plain-output-prefix* option.

# turnCount2EdgeCount.py

This script converts turn-count data into [edgeData](../Simulation/Output/Lane-_or_Edge-based_Traffic_Measures.md).

```
<SUMO_HOME>/tools/turn-defs/turnCount2EdgeCount.py -t <turn-file> -o <output-file>
```

# turnFile2EdgeRelations.py

This script converts the deprecated turn-file format into edgeRelation format

```
<SUMO_HOME>/tools/turn-defs/turnFile2EdgeRelations.py -t <turn-file> -o <output-file>
```
